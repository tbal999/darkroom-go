# darkroom-go
A simple console based dungeon crawler game in go.

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tbal999/darkroom-go/master/goexample.gif)

The aim of the game is to get as many points as possible. Press w, s, a, d to move around. Every time you complete a dungeon, you gain 2 points. Every time you kill a monster, you gain a point. 
The dungeons are randomly sized and the creatures/items you find are randomly scattered in the dungeon.
Have fun!
